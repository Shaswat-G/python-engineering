## 💡 Learning Approach

This course is designed around a learn-by-doing pedagogy:

```python
def learning_philosophy():
    concepts = ["theory", "examples", "practice", "projects"]
    knowledge = 0

    for concept in concepts:
        knowledge += apply(concept)
        if reflect_and_improve(knowledge):
            continue

    return mastery
```
